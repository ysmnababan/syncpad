**ID:** TKT-003
**Status:** Todo
**Priority:** High
**Planned Score:** 3
**Actual Score:** 3
**Created:** 2025-09-23

## 🎯 Goal

Learn Raft consensus algorithm as a practical and understandable consensus protocol.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

* [ ] (Optional) Read [Raft Paper](https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf)
* [ ] (Optional but recommended) Run a small etcd/Consul cluster locally and observe leader re-election
* [X] Try [Raft Visualization Demo](https://raft.github.io/)
* [X] Watch [Video Explanation](https://youtu.be/IujMVjKvWP4?si=uvhN8Pj-McgPbs3Q)
* [X] Write a short summary of leader election, log replication, and safety in Raft
* [X] Capture 2–3 takeaways (e.g., how Raft avoids split-brain)

## 📝 Notes
Raft is easier to learn than Paxos and widely used in production (CockroachDB, etcd, Consul).
