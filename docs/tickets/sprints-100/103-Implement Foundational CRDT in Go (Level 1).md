# Ticket: Implement Foundational CRDTs in Go (Level 1)

**ID:** TKT-CRDT-01
**Status:** Todo
**Priority:** High
**Planned Score:** 3
**Actual Score:** <fill in after completion>
**Created:** 2025-10-10

## üéØ Goal

Build intuition on how **commutative replication** and **eventual consistency** work in CRDTs by implementing and simulating simple state-based types (G-Counter, PN-Counter, and OR-Set) in Go.

By the end of this ticket, you should *feel confident* explaining:

* How CRDTs achieve convergence without central coordination
* Why operations can arrive in any order and still yield the same state
* How to merge distributed state safely

---

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

* [ ] Implement at least **two Level-1 CRDTs** in Go: G-Counter, PN-Counter, or OR-Set
* [ ] Simulate **at least 2‚Äì3 replicas** (using goroutines or functions) exchanging state and merging periodically
* [ ] Observe and record behavior when updates arrive in different orders
* [ ] Write a short summary explaining what ‚Äúeventual convergence‚Äù *feels like* in practice
* [ ] Capture 2‚Äì3 takeaways relevant to backend design (e.g., merge semantics, idempotency, metadata growth)

---

## üìù Notes

**Suggested steps:**

* Start with in-memory structs and local merging logic
* No networking required ‚Äî simulate with local goroutines or simple function calls
* Optional: Add randomized message delay to visualize eventual consistency
* Don‚Äôt worry about deletes or compaction yet
* Resources to skim:

  * *CRDTs Illustrated* ([https://crdt.tech](https://crdt.tech))
  * Martin Kleppmann‚Äôs blog ‚ÄúA Critique of Operational Transformation‚Äù (background motivation)

**Intuition target:**

> ‚ÄúI understand how state-based CRDTs reach the same final value no matter what order operations arrive, and I can visualize merge behavior in Go code.‚Äù
