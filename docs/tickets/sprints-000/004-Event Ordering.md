**ID:** TKT-004
**Status:** Done
**Priority:** Medium
**Planned Score:** 5
**Actual Score:** 5
**Created:** 2025-10-03

### üéØ Goal

Understand how distributed systems reason about order and causality of events without global clocks.

### ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

* [ ] (Optional) Read Lamport‚Äôs paper: *Time, Clocks, and Ordering of Events* ([PDF](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/papers/times.pdf))
* [X] Learn vector clocks from at least one tutorial or lecture
* [X] Implement or run a tiny simulation (Lamport clock or vector clock) to see event ordering
* [X] Write a short note on the difference between Lamport clocks and vector clocks
* [X] Capture 2‚Äì3 takeaways (why causality matters for OT/CRDT)
